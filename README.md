Your terminal should just be a browser tab.

Run `npx localterm@latest start` and every browser tab is one shell. Open a new tab to spawn another. Close the tab to kill it. That's the whole product.

## Install

Run this command anywhere:

```bash
npx localterm@latest start
```

This boots a local daemon and opens [`http://localterm.localhost:3417`](http://localterm.localhost:3417) in your browser. (`*.localhost` is reserved by [RFC 6761](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6761) and resolves to `127.0.0.1` in every modern browser, so no `/etc/hosts` edit needed.)

To install globally:

```bash
npm install -g localterm
localterm start
```

## Usage

The mental model is **shell = browser tab**:

- **New tab** → new shell
- **Close tab** → shell dies immediately
- **Reload tab** → fresh shell (the prior one is gone)

No session ids, no URL slugs, no reconnects. If you want a long-lived shell that survives reloads, run `tmux` _inside_ localterm.

## CLI

```bash
localterm start [-p 3417] [-H 127.0.0.1] [--no-open]   # daemonizes by default
localterm stop
localterm status
localterm restart
```

State lives in `~/.localterm/` (PID, port, server log at `~/.localterm/server.log`).

## Security

- Binds loopback hosts only: `127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, `*.localhost`, `::1`. Non-loopback values are rejected.
- `/api/*` and `/ws` enforce loopback `Host` and `Origin` headers to defeat DNS-rebinding attacks.
- One PTY per WebSocket. Closing the tab kills the shell — no orphaned processes.
