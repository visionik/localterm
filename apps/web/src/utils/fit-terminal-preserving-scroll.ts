/**
 * Wraps `fitAddon.fit()` so the user's scrollback position survives the resize.
 *
 * `fit()` calls `terminal.resize()`, which reflows the buffer when the column
 * count changes (lines wrap/unwrap, total row count shifts). xterm.js does not
 * preserve the viewport's distance from the bottom across that reflow, so the
 * user's scroll position visibly jumps to the bottom of the buffer.
 *
 * Strategy: snapshot the viewport's distance from the bottom before fit(), then
 * scroll the same distance up after fit(). If the user was already at the
 * bottom, keep them at the bottom (matches xterm.js's default behavior).
 *
 * Returns `true` if the resize was applied, `false` if `fit()` threw (typically
 * an unmeasured container during the very first paint). Callers that need to
 * react to the new dimensions (e.g. send a resize frame upstream) should bail
 * out when this returns `false`.
 *
 * Buffer assumption: we read `terminal.buffer.active` before AND after fit().
 * `fit()` is purely a column/row resize and never toggles the alt screen, so
 * both reads return the same buffer in practice. If a future xterm.js change
 * makes `fit()` cause a buffer swap, the math here would need to snapshot the
 * specific buffer (normal vs alt) explicitly.
